# What is this ?
Got bored repeating / recreating a menus system for libtcod (python version), so decided to make this reusable library.

# How to use ?
Put this lib (everything but the test.py file) in your libtcod python project, preferably under a package folder you created so you keep your project tidy.

Then, just import the menus, they are useable as is.

# TODO
* Comments / doc
* More menus than the simple one
* Generalisation
* Credits

# A problem?
Just open a ticket here on github, I'll reply asap.

PS: Contributions / ideas are welcome, of course
